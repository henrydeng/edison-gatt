This repo is my implementation of the following vision: http://rexstjohn.com/how-i-want-to-develop-code-for-intel-edison/

Step 1: http://rexstjohn.com/getting-wi-fi-with-intel-edison/

Step 2: http://rexstjohn.com/configure-intel-edison-for-bluetooth-le-smart-development/#more-2958

Step 3: http://rexstjohn.com/setting-up-intel-edison-with-intel-xdk/

Once you have done that, you should be able to build and deploy the XDK project.

You will also need this application to help scan for and check your BLE services hosted on Edison: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id639944780?mt=12

This requires Mac computer capable of BLE (Bluetooth 4.0), no reason you couldn't do the same with Windows using a similar BLE scanner diagnostic tool.
