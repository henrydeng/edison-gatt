IntelEdisonBLEGATT
==================

This is an experimental build system for Intel Edison which relies on BLE and a paired mobile application. Developers can configure 
their Edison's Wi-Fi settings and set a GitHub repo via a mobile application. Then, they can deploy code to the GitHub repo and build /
install / run the code on their Edison by pressing a "deploy" button on their phone.

There are two components to this project:

1.) A BLE GATT profile for Intel Edison and build system using GitHub
2.) A remote control app to configure Edison's settings via BLE
